# IEEE-SSCI-2025-FJSSP-WF-Competition

### Competition abstract
The competition on Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-WF-Com) addresses a critical challenge faced by many industries: the task of optimizing production schedules in flexible job shops with multiskilled (or flexible) workers. These workers play an important role in cost or time optimization, and their restricted availability can lead to increased scheduling complexity. The FJSSP-WF-Com aims to minimize makespan across the wide range of 402 FJSSP-WF test problems. These problem instances are systematically generated based on well-established FJSSP problem instances from literature. In this way, the competition is intended to provide a framework for the comprehensive evaluation and targeted comparison of scheduling algorithms for FJSSP-WF problems. The FJSSP-WF-Com thus offers a new opportunity to assess the broad applicability of the algorithms and to demonstrate their practical relevance for balancing employee flexibility, machine utilization and production time in dynamic production environments.
